              <h1>OUR VISION</h1>
              <p>
                Our long-term goal is to develop OTEX to the point it becomes
                the most active enabler of transactions on-chain. In short, we
                are aiming for a future in which no on-chain transaction is
                executed and settled without OTEX being involved (from providing
                liquidity, to smart order routing, to mining and settling the
                transactions).
              </p>
              <p>HOW WILL WE ACHIEVE OUR VISION?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We started by developing trade optimization and trade
                  execution needed by specialized protocols such as COW
                  protocol.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As we improve our technology, we will aim to integrate our
                  systems in to new protocols or simply start participating in
                  existing markets.
